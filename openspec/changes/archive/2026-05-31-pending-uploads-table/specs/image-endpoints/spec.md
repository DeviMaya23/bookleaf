## MODIFIED Requirements

### Requirement: Image Repository Interface

The system SHALL define an `ImageRepository` interface in `internal/usecase/` that the SQL repository implements.

Methods:
- `Create(ctx, image *domain.Image) (*domain.Image, error)`
- `List(ctx context.Context, userID string, folderID *uuid.UUID, unfiled bool, tagID *uuid.UUID, cursor *ImageCursor, limit int) ([]*domain.Image, error)` — returns non-deleted images ordered by `(created_at DESC, id DESC)`; fetches `limit + 1` rows so the caller can detect next-page existence; `folderID` nil means no folder filter; `tagID` nil means no tag filter; `unfiled` true limits to images with no entry in `image_folders`; images are returned with their `Tags` and `ImageFolders` preloaded; no `is_uploaded` filter is needed as every row in `images` is committed
- `GetByID(ctx, id uuid.UUID, userID string) (*domain.Image, error)` — returns non-deleted images only; result has `Tags` and `ImageFolders` preloaded
- `GetDeletedByID(ctx, id uuid.UUID, userID string) (*domain.Image, error)` — returns soft-deleted images only; result has `ImageFolders` preloaded
- `UpdateThumbnailPath(ctx, id uuid.UUID, thumbnailPath string) error` — updates `thumbnail_path`; no ownership check (called internally by goroutine)
- `UpdateAILabels(ctx, id uuid.UUID, labels json.RawMessage) error`
- `Update(ctx, id uuid.UUID, userID string, fields map[string]any) (*domain.Image, error)` — selectively updates the supplied scalar fields for the image owned by `userID`; `folder_id` is NOT a valid key in the map (folder assignment is handled by `SetImageFolder`); result has `Tags` and `ImageFolders` preloaded
- `SetImageFolder(ctx context.Context, imageID uuid.UUID, folderID *uuid.UUID) error` — see `image-folders` spec for full behaviour
- `SoftDelete(ctx, id uuid.UUID, userID string) error`
- `Restore(ctx, id uuid.UUID, userID string) error`
- `ListTrashed(ctx context.Context, userID string, cursor *ImageCursor, limit int) ([]*domain.Image, error)` — returns soft-deleted images ordered by `(deleted_at ASC, id ASC)`; fetches `limit + 1` rows; `cursor` nil means first page
- `CountByFolderID(ctx context.Context, folderID uuid.UUID) (int64, error)` — counts non-deleted images with a row in `image_folders` for the given folder; implemented as `Model(&domain.Image{}) + JOIN image_folders WHERE image_folders.folder_id = ?`
- `ListExpiredTrash(ctx context.Context, olderThan time.Time) ([]*domain.Image, error)`
- `HardDelete(ctx context.Context, id uuid.UUID, userID string) error`

`ListStaleUploads` is REMOVED from this interface. Stale upload detection is now handled by `PendingUploadRepository.ListStale`.

#### Scenario: Repository interface is satisfied by SQL implementation

- **WHEN** the Go package is compiled
- **THEN** `imageRepository` in `internal/repository/` implements `usecase.ImageRepository` without compilation errors

#### Scenario: List preloads tags and image folders for each image

- **WHEN** `List` is called and images have associated tags and folder memberships
- **THEN** each returned `domain.Image` has its `Tags` and `ImageFolders` slices populated

#### Scenario: List filters by folder via join

- **WHEN** `List` is called with a non-nil `folderID`
- **THEN** only images with a row in `image_folders` for that folder are returned
- **AND** the query uses `Model(&domain.Image{})` as the base so soft-deleted images are excluded automatically

#### Scenario: List unfiled uses left join

- **WHEN** `List` is called with `unfiled = true`
- **THEN** only images with no row in `image_folders` are returned
- **AND** the query uses a LEFT JOIN on `image_folders` and filters where the join produces no match

#### Scenario: GetByID preloads tags and image folders

- **WHEN** `GetByID` is called for an image that has tags and a folder membership
- **THEN** the returned `domain.Image` has its `Tags` and `ImageFolders` slices populated

#### Scenario: List filters by tagID when provided

- **WHEN** `List` is called with a non-nil `tagID`
- **THEN** only images associated with that tag are returned

#### Scenario: CountByFolderID excludes soft-deleted images

- **WHEN** a folder contains 3 images of which one is soft-deleted
- **THEN** `CountByFolderID` returns `2`

### Requirement: POST /images — Initiate Upload Request and Response

The `POST /images` handler SHALL accept an optional `description` field and an optional `folder_id` field in the request body.

When `folder_id` is provided, the usecase SHALL look up the folder by ID scoped to the authenticated user via `folderRepo.GetByID`. If the folder is not found, `folder_id` SHALL be stored as `nil` in the `pending_uploads` record. No error SHALL be returned to the caller in this case.

The usecase SHALL create a row in `pending_uploads` (not `images`) with all initiation-time metadata including `folder_id`. No row is written to `image_folders` at this point; folder assignment is deferred to `CompleteUpload`.

Request body:
```json
{
  "title": "string (required)",
  "mime_type": "string (required)",
  "source_url": "string (optional)",
  "folder_id": "uuid (optional)",
  "description": "string (optional)"
}
```

Response body (201): `id`, `upload_url`, `r2_path`. The `id` in the response is the `pending_uploads.id`, which will become `images.id` upon commit.

#### Scenario: Upload initiated with a valid folder_id

- **WHEN** an authenticated `POST /images` request includes a `folder_id` that exists and belongs to the user
- **THEN** the response is `201 Created`
- **AND** a row exists in `pending_uploads` with the provided `folder_id`
- **AND** no row exists yet in `image_folders` (folder assignment is deferred to CompleteUpload)

#### Scenario: Upload initiated with a folder_id that does not exist

- **WHEN** an authenticated `POST /images` request includes a `folder_id` that does not exist (or belongs to another user)
- **THEN** the response is `201 Created`
- **AND** the `pending_uploads` row has `folder_id = NULL`

#### Scenario: Upload initiated with null or omitted folder_id

- **WHEN** an authenticated `POST /images` request omits `folder_id` or sets it to `null`
- **THEN** the response is `201 Created`
- **AND** the `pending_uploads` row has `folder_id = NULL`

#### Scenario: Upload initiated with description

- **WHEN** an authenticated `POST /images` request includes a non-empty `description`
- **THEN** the response is `201 Created`
- **AND** the `pending_uploads` row has the supplied `description` value persisted

#### Scenario: Upload initiated without description

- **WHEN** an authenticated `POST /images` request omits `description`
- **THEN** the response is `201 Created`
- **AND** the `pending_uploads` row has `description` as NULL
